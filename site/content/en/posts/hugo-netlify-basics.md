I have been using [cPanel](https://cpanel.net/) for hosting and editing my personal website in the past few years. It comes with a clean text editor for editing your code files. The hosting fee for cPanel is also relatively cheap. Since my website's just for "fun", I chose the cheapest shared hosting plan from Namecheap. I do enjoy cPanel's editor because I prefer writing code rather than using the drag/drop functionality that other popular website content management systems offer. I just feel like I have more control over my website when I write the code. The only downside of using cPanel is that I am missing the source code's history. Even though I am the only contributor in my website, I realised that this is still very important for me since I enjoy experimenting and making changes from time to time. So when my webhosting plan expired, I searched for other solutions and then I found [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

Netlify is an all-in-one platform for automating modern web projects. You can use it to replace your hosting infrastructure, continuous integration, and deployment pipeline with a single workflow. It also allows you to integrate dynamic functionality like serverless functions, user authentication, and form handling as your projects grow.

Assuming you already have uploaded your website's codebase in Github and created a free Netlify account, then automating the build and deployment is a breeze. 

1. Click 'New Site from Git' button in the Team Overview's page.

2. Connect to Git provider. 
Choose your provider and then a pop-up window will appear to authorize Netlify's access to your source control.

3. Pick the repository which contains your website's codebase.
Use the handy search bar if you have a lot of repos

4. Configure settings like branch to deploy, build command, publish directory. Once done, click 'Deploy' button.

5. Push changes to repo and see a deploy triggers automatically in Netlify.

If build and deploy is successful, you should be able to see visual changes when you browse your site. 
Congrats! You just created a Continuous Deployment pipeline for your website. ðŸŽ‰
