{{< figure src="/images/my-photo.jpeg" title="Hi, I'm Lorna!">}}

I was born in the Philippines. I started my career as a Software Developer when I was 19. 

I studied Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. During the first semester of my first year, I fell in love with programming.
Solving problems through coding gives me a magical feeling. No, I am not the magician in this feeling - I was more of the kid in the audience who was too much in awe of what I was seeing.

As many other programmers, the first piece of program I wrote was:

```golang
Hello, world!
```
Right after graduation, I started my career as an Entry Software Engineer at Emerson Process Management. I have spent 7 good years in my first company. I learned a lot about .NET and C#, WPF, and even the old school C++ and VBScript languages. 

In 2017, I moved to New Zealand and got a job as a Software Developer at Xero. I didn't know all that I didn't know back then until I moved here. I learned how to use GA to understand audience behaviors, I broadened my .NET skill with RESTful APIs and Microservices, got my AWS Developer certification, learned about CI/CD, picked up my front end development skill with React and Typescript, and a whole bunch more! 

I realised there's more to being a developer than just understanding the requirements, designing the solution and coding it, and then delivering the product.
