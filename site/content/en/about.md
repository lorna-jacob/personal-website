 >Hi, I'm Lorna!

I was born in the Philippines. I started my career as a Software Developer when I was 19. 

I studied Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. During the first semester of my first year, I fell in love with programming.
Solving problems through coding gives me a magical feeling.

As many other programmers, the first piece of program I wrote was:

```golang
Hello, world!
```

Right after graduation, I started my career as an Entry Software Engineer at Emerson Process Management. I have spent 7 good years in my first company. I learned a lot about .NET and C#, WPF, and even the old school C++ and VBScript languages. 

In 2017, I moved to New Zealand and got a job as a Software Developer at Xero. I didn't know all that I didn't know back then until I moved here. I learned how to use GA to understand audience behaviors, I broadened my .NET skill with RESTful APIs and Microservices, got my AWS Developer certification, learned about CI/CD, picked up my front end development skill with React and Typescript, and a whole bunch more!
